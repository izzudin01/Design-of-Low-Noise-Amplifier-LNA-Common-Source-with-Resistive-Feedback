# Design-of-Low-Noise-Amplifier-LNA-Common-Source-with-Resistive-Feedback
This project focuses on the design and simulation of a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) using a common-source topology with resistive feedback, operating in the 3.6â€“3.8 GHz frequency range. The goal was to achieve high gain, low noise, and good impedance matching for RF front-end applications.
