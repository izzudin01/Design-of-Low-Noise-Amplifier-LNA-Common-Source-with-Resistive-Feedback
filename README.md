Frequency Range: 3.6 – 3.8 GHz  
Target Gain (S21): > 10 dB  
Input Reflection (S11): < –10 dB  
Output Reflection (S22): < –10 dB  
Noise Figure (NF): < 3 dB

## Project Outcomes  
Simulation Results at 3.7 GHz:  
Gain (S21): 10.10 dB  
Input Reflection (S11): –13.54 dB  
Output Reflection (S22): –16.05 dB  
Noise Figure (NF): 0.195 dB  
Power Dissipation: 47.5 nW  

* Achieved excellent impedance matching confirmed by Smith Chart analysis.
